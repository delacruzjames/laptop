# laptop

This sets up your Mac for development.

## Instructions

1. Set up your dotfiles first so you get a copy of .laptop.local which is run at the end of this script. See mine at [kriskhaira/dotfiles](https://github.com/kriskhaira/dotfiles).

1. Clone this repo somewhere and run the laptop script.

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:kriskhaira/laptop.git ~/code/laptop
  ~/code/laptop/mac
  ```

1. Install your Vim plugins

  ```
  vim
  :PlugInstall
  ```
